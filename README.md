instruction to making a first repository
Hi my name is Jordan, and I live in California.
I am a single father, with two boys 3 and 9.
One of them lives with me the 3 year old, and the other lives with his mother in Mexico.
I just recently Graduated from a college in the Course trade as an HVAC Technician.
And now here I am! Learning to code.
